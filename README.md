# Python-Homeworks
This is my current collection of all homework for my Python course, based on the Think Python textbook. I would like to remind you that your teacher will probably be able to tell if you just copy my code, but we've all been there. This probably 
isn't 100% correct, but I comment obsessively, so it should provide some guidance. Let me know if it helped.
